**Also known as:** Wrapper

**Intent:** Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending
functionality.

**Applicability:** Use Decorator

* to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically, without affecting other objects
* Sometimes a large number of independent extensions are possible and would produce an explosion of subclasses to support every combination.
